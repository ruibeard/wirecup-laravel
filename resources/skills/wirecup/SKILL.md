# Skill: wirecup

Wirecup is a tiny DSL for low-fidelity UI mockups.

This skill is the canonical spec and operating guide.

## Workflow

Open the Laravel preview at `/wirecup`.

Where to write mocks:

```
.agents/.cup/login.cup
.agents/.cup/dashboard.cup
.agents/.cup/product.cup
```

Route behaviour:

- `/wirecup` shows a sidebar listing all `.cup` files with a live iframe preview
- `/wirecup/render/login.cup` renders `.agents/.cup/login.cup`
- `/wirecup/render/dashboard.cup` renders `.agents/.cup/dashboard.cup`
- the newest `.cup` file is selected by default when no default is configured

## Spec

### Core rule

The first non-space character on a line selects the element type.

Everything after that character is the element content.

The space after the type character is optional.

### Elements

| Char | Element    | Meaning                                       |
|------|------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `n`  | nav        | horizontal navigation row                     |
| `h`  | heading    | section heading                               |
| `t`  | text       | paragraph or label text                       |
| `i`  | input      | input placeholder box                         |
| `b`  | button     | button or linked button                       |
| `x`  | image      | image/chart/media placeholder                 |
| `s`  | select     | select/dropdown placeholder                   |
| `l`  | list item  | bullet list item                              |
| `v`  | badge      | small neutral pill                            |
| `a`  | alert      | neutral message box                           |
| `k`  | checkbox   | checkbox row                                  |
| `u`  | include    | reusable snippet or built-in helper           |
| `c`  | card       | container for indented children               |
| `r`  | row        | horizontal flex group for indented children   |
| `g`  | grid       | table-like block                              |
| `-`  | divider    | thin divider                                  |
| `=`  | divider    | thick divider                                 |

### Text elements

`h`, `t`, `v`, `a`, `k`, `x`, and `s` render exactly the text you provide.

### Input

`i` renders an input placeholder box.

An empty `i` renders a blank placeholder line.

### Buttons and nav links

`n` and `b` support `label|target` links.

Target resolution rules:

- `http*` stays unchanged
- `/route` stays unchanged
- `target.cup` becomes `/target`
- `target` becomes `/target`
- if there is no `|target`, the item is non-navigating

### Includes

`u` expands a reusable snippet.

Built-in:

- `u ballot-nav current-route`

This renders the shared ballot navigation and leaves the current route non-clickable.

Custom snippets:

- create `.agents/.cup/_includes/name.cup`
- reference it with `u name arg1 arg2`
- use `$1`, `$2`, and `$*` inside the include file

### Lists

Consecutive `l` lines are grouped into one list.

### Dividers

Use `-` for a thin divider and `=` for a thick divider.

### Containers and indentation

`c`, `r`, and `g` take indented child lines.

Indentation defines structure.

Children continue until indentation returns to the parent level.

### Grid

`g` creates a table-like layout.

The `g` line is the header row.

Indented lines under it are body rows.

Cells are split by 2 or more spaces.

Grid cell rules:

- cells starting with `v ` render as badges
- cells starting with `b ` render as buttons
- other cell text renders as plain text
- cells may be separated by tabs or by 2 or more spaces

### Compact mode

For lower token usage:

- omit the space after the element character, for example `hTitle`
- use minimal indentation, for example one space per level
- prefer tabs in `g` header and row cells

### Alerts and badges

Badges and alerts are neutral sketch elements.

They do not carry semantic color meaning in the spec.

### Error rule

Unknown element characters are invalid.

If a line starts with an unsupported first character, that is a spec error.

Examples belong in `examples/`, not in this skill.
